I am now a third-year Ph.D. candidate at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (2022-present). I am advised by Prof. [Haikun Liu](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/liuhaikun/zh_CN/index/872473/list/index.htm). I enjoy working in [CGCL lab](https://grid.hust.edu.cn/). My research interests focus on Large-scale Vector Search System, Computational Storage, and CXL.
